Paytm possesses a massive merchant ecosystem and is pivoting toward higher‑margin financial services, positioning the company for a breakeven point in FY26 and strong profit growth thereafter. The upside potential (price targets up to **₹1,420**) is balanced by significant regulatory and competitive risks.

- **Conservative investors** should monitor regulatory developments and cash‑flow trends before scaling exposure.
