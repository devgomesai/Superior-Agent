|------|--------|
| **Cloud growth deceleration** | Cloud infrastructure revenue growth slowed to 49 % YoY (vs. 52 % prior quarter). |
| **Scale vs. hyperscalers** | Oracle remains smaller than AWS/Azure/Google; must sustain heavy CAPEX to close gap. |
| **Execution risk** | Rapid datacenter expansion and large AI projects could face delays or cost overruns. |
| **Geographic exposure** | Asia‑Pacific revenue up only 0.9 % YoY; reliance on Americas. |
| **Valuation volatility** | High expectations for AI/cloud growth make the stock sensitive to any slowdown. |

## 6. Outlook (Fiscal 2026)

- **Revenue guidance:** Management projects ~15 % YoY revenue increase for FY 2026, driven by cloud & AI.

- **Cash flow:** Continued strong operating cash flow anticipated, supporting dividend growth and share repurchases.

## 7. Investment Summary (Institutional View)

Oracle is transitioning from a traditional enterprise‑software vendor to a competitive AI‑cloud infrastructure player. The Q3 FY 2025 results show solid top‑line growth and a massive backlog, but a modest earnings miss has introduced short‑term price pressure. Key upside drivers are AI‑related GPU capacity, the AI Data Platform, and a rapidly expanding RPO base. Primary concerns revolve around execution risk, competitive pressure from larger hyperscalers, and the recent slowdown in cloud‑infrastructure growth.

**Recommendation:** Maintain a **long‑term overweight** stance for investors comfortable with near‑term volatility, while monitoring cloud growth trends and execution of AI infrastructure projects.
