Investors should closely monitor Tesla's delivery volumes, margin trends, progress on autonomy, competitive pricing dynamics, and any shifts in the regulatory or reputational landscape. These factors will likely influence the stock's performance in the near to medium term. The high valuation multiples suggest that any disappointment in growth or profitability could lead to significant stock price volatility.
